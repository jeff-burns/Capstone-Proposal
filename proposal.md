# PROJECT DESCRIPTION

##     Problem Statement
        *For many years now, I have had a major problem with getting up to my alarm. I will hit the snooze button several times on most mornings. But, I've also realized I'm not alone with this problem.

        *A quick Google search on this issue resulted in many articles- ranging from Business Insider to Huffington Post to AARP to Slate to Men's Health. All of them are either about how to quit hitting the snooze button or about it's ill effects.

        *There is most definitely something psychological at the root of the problem. But until someone solves that, or I solve it for myself, there can be some adjustments made to the alarm "clock", itself. Enter the Lights Out Alarm.

##     How My Project Solve This Problem
        This project will be an app integrated with minimal hardware that will allow the user to wake up closer to the time they initially desired. By shutting off only when the light sensor on the hardware reads that the lights in the room have been turned on, it will make going back to sleep after hitting the snooze button much more difficult.

        It will also track the user data, which can help the user see if it's working and, if not, what can be adjusted. This will be a post to a database on the time it took for the lights to turn on each time used.

        Stretch Goals:
            Sounding the alarm again if the lights have turned off within one minute of being turned on.

            Allowing a the light sensitivity to be adjustable so it can work for a daytime sleeper.

            Implementing the ability to turn the lights on when the alarm begins, as well as, moving out of my reach. 
            For turning the lights on, it would need some integration software for my lighting system OR have it's own lighting that can simulate sunrise.
            For the mobility, it would need a motor, wheels/tracks and sensors to avoid obstacles.

            Integrating a weather app that will tell the user how the conditions will be at the start and end of the transit to their destination.

            Integrating a music database, or any online streaming music to be the alarm. As well as, hooking it up to a larger stereo system.

##     Map The User Experience
        Margaret and George are parents of 3. They both work and have to send the kids off to their respective schools every weekday. It can be difficult to keep track of each child waking up, in separate rooms, on time, while performing many tasks. All 3 children will randomly oversleep, either hitting the snooze button or turning the alarm off entirely. George and Margaret decide to get the Light Out Alarm for each child. Some of them still take a little time to turn the lights on, but at most, they are only able to oversleep for a few minutes. It works well enough for the children that the parents also start using it.

        Malcolm is a college student, so naturally, he keeps odd hours. He will stay up all night studying, or doing other things- or he gets to sleep too early, so that he is falling back asleep by the time he should be getting up for class. He even has to take naps in between classes sometimes. So, it is vital that he gets up to his alarm, since he can't miss tests or deadlines for his classes. He starts using the Lights Out Alarm. This allows him to get to his classes on time, therefore not affecting his grades.
